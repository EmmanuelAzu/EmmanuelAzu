# 👋 Hi there, I’m Emmanuel!

I’m a Computer Science graduate from **Wits University** who loves building **cool, practical AI-powered web apps** 🚀  

I’m especially interested in:
- 🤖 Applying AI to **optimize workflows**
- 🧠 Turning complex problems into **clean, usable systems**
- 🌐 Building modern **web applications** that actually get used

From intelligent automation to full-stack AI products, I enjoy taking ideas from *“what if?”* to *“it works.”*  
Always curious, always building — let’s create something impactful.

**Let’s build cool AI stuff, shall we?**
